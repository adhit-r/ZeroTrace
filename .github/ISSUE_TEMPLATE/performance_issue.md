## ⚡ **Performance Issue**

### **Description**
A clear and concise description of the performance problem.

### **Performance Impact**
- **Component**: [e.g. API, Enrichment, Agent, Frontend]
- **Metric**: [e.g. Response time, CPU usage, Memory usage, Throughput]
- **Current Value**: [e.g. 500ms, 80% CPU, 2GB RAM, 100 req/s]
- **Expected Value**: [e.g. 100ms, 5% CPU, 50MB RAM, 1000 req/s]

### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Deploy with '...' configuration
2. Send '...' requests
3. Monitor '...' metrics
4. Observe performance degradation

### **Environment**
- **Deployment**: [e.g. Local, Staging, Production]
