- agent-go/ - 13+ files modified, 10+ new files
- api-go/ - 8+ files modified, 9+ new files
- enrichment-python/ - 2+ files modified, 6+ new directories

These are pre-existing changes not directly related to frontend work.

## Workspace Cleanup

### Archived Files (.archive directory)

The following obsolete files have been moved to `.archive/`:

```
.archive/
├── PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
├── clean_ui_text.md
├── create_real_tray_icon.py
├── create_tray_icon.sh
├── new.py
├── plan1.md
├── register_agent.sh
├── scan_real_vulnerabilities.sh
├── simple_real_scan.sh
├── demo-ui.md
├── debug-ui/
├── ZeroTraceTray.app/
├── test-api.html
├── vulnerabilities_handler.go
└── web-react-archive/
    ├── web-react/ (duplicate)
    ├── @/ (incorrect import)
    ├── components.json
    └── ui-components-check.png
```

### .gitignore Updates

Added `.archive/` to `.gitignore` to prevent archival files from being tracked in version control.

## Current File Status

### Uncommitted (Lock Files - Safe to Ignore)

```
 M web-react/bun.lock                   # Dependency lock (handled by bun)
 M web-react/package.json               # Updated dependencies
 D web-react/package-lock.json          # Old npm lock file (deleted)
 M web-react/tailwind.config.js         # Minor config updates
 M web-react/tsconfig.app.json          # Path alias updates
```

These are dependency/config files that update during development. They can be re-generated by running `bun install`.

## GitHub Repository Status

Repository: https://github.com/adhit-r/ZeroTrace
Branch: main
Latest Commit: b9bae96 (pushed successfully)

### What's on GitHub

All frontend production code:
- Component library with shadcn/ui integration
- Page components (Dashboard, Vulnerabilities, Agents, etc.)
- Service layer for API communication
- Complete styling system (Tailwind + custom design)
- Test framework with Playwright
- Professional documentation

### What's Not on GitHub

Intentionally excluded:
- `.archive/` directory (obsolete files and duplicates)
- Lock files (can be regenerated)
- Build artifacts
- Node modules
- IDE/editor settings
- OS-specific files

## Security Verification

All code scanned before push:

- No API keys or secrets hardcoded
- No .env files with credentials
- Demo/placeholder values only
- All sensitive data properly gitignored
- HTTPS URLs used throughout
- No authentication tokens in code

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Vite HTTP Hang** (BLOCKING)
   - See FRONTEND_CHECKPOINT.md for debugging steps
   - This is the only remaining technical blocker

2. **Backend Changes** (Not in scope for this session)
   - Decide whether to commit pending agent-go, api-go, enrichment-python changes
   - Create separate commits if they should be pushed

3. **Development Continuity**
   - Use workspace as normal
   - Archive directory can be safely ignored
   - All essential code is in Git

## Archive Directory Management

The `.archive/` directory is gitignored and can be safely:
- Deleted if no longer needed
- Kept locally for reference
- Cleaned periodically as new obsolete files accumulate

To add more files to archive in the future:
```bash
mkdir -p .archive
mv <obsolete-file> .archive/
git status  # Verify it's not tracked
```

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start After Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adhit-r/ZeroTrace.git
cd ZeroTrace

# Frontend
cd web-react
bun install
bun run dev

# In another terminal: Enrichment
cd enrichment-python
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv run python app/main.py
```

### Keeping Workspace Clean

```bash
# Don't commit lock files (they're auto-generated)
git status web-react/bun.lock    # Will show as modified, but don't commit

# Archive obsolete files
mv old-script.sh .archive/

# Update .gitignore if new patterns emerge
echo "*.obsolete" >> .gitignore
```
