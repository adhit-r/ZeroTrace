# macOS Tray Icon Solution

## Problem Identified

The ZeroTrace agent tray icon is intentionally disabled on macOS due to a known crash issue with the `fyne.io/systray` library. This is why you don't see a tray icon when running the agent on your Mac.

## Solutions Implemented

### Option 1: Enhanced Error Handling (Recommended)

I've updated the tray implementation to:
- Enable tray icon on macOS with proper crash recovery
- Graceful fallback if systray crashes
- Continue agent operation even if tray fails

### Option 2: macOS-Specific Alternative

Created a macOS-specific tray manager that:
- Runs without systray library
- Provides status logging instead of tray icon
- Maintains full functionality without GUI

## How to Test

### Quick Test

```bash
cd agent-go
./test-macos-agent.sh
```

### Manual Test

```bash
# Build the agent
go build -o agent ./cmd/agent/

# Set environment variables
export ZEROTRACE_API_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8080"
export ZEROTRACE_ORGANIZATION_ID="test-org-123"

# Run the agent
./agent
```

## What You'll See

### With Enhanced Error Handling

- Tray icon appears (if systray works)
- Agent continues if tray crashes
- Status logging in console

### With macOS-Specific Manager

- No tray icon (by design)
- Background operation with status logs
- Full agent functionality

## Troubleshooting

### If Tray Still Doesn't Appear

1. **Check macOS Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Check if agent has necessary permissions
   ps aux | grep zerotrace
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs**
   ```bash
   # Look for systray errors
   tail -f agent.log
   ```

3. **Verify Agent is Running**
   ```bash
   # Check if agent process is active
   pgrep -f zerotrace
   ```

### Alternative: Use Web Dashboard

Since the tray icon has issues on macOS, you can:
- Monitor via web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`
- Check agent logs in `agent.log`
- Use process monitoring with `ps aux | grep zerotrace`

## Expected Behavior

### On macOS

- **Tray Icon**: May or may not appear (depends on systray compatibility)
- **Agent Function**: Fully operational
- **Status Monitoring**: Via logs and web dashboard
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Works perfectly

### On Windows/Linux

- **Tray Icon**: Always appears
- **Agent Function**: Fully operational
- **Status Monitoring**: Via tray menu

## Next Steps

1. **Test the agent** using the provided script
2. **Check the web dashboard** for agent data
3. **Monitor logs** for any issues
4. **Report results** if problems persist

The agent will function completely even without the tray icon on macOS!
